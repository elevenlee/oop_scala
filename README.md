This assignment introduces you to programming in Scala and to some of its more interesting features.


1. The code was written under the Ubuntu Linux System (Version 11.10)
2. The Compiler version is GCC 4.6.1
3. The format of compiling source code is as below:

    scalac Sorted.scala

4. The format of running source code is as below:

    scala Test

5. Firstly, I define a "Complex" class which implements a complex number
   in format "a + bi". The Complex class has two parameters. The first one
   represents the real part of number and the second one represents the 
   imaginary part of number. Two complex number compares by their square of
   length, that is "a^2 + b^2".

6. Secondly, I define a "SortedList" generic class which implements a sorted
   list. The output format of this generic class is as below:
   
   SortedList(object 1, object 2, object 3, ...)
   
7. All test method result is in "Test" object
